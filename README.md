# Bitwise_Operation
## AIM
To understand how bitwise operators work in C++ and their syntax
## THEORY
In C++, bitwise operators perform operations on integer data at the individual bit-level. These operations include testing, setting, or shifting the actual bits. These operators are necessary because the Arithmetic-Logic Unit (ALU) present in the computer's CPU carries out arithmetic operations at the bit-level.
